This is a xlsxio wrapper  for Nim. It is meant for lighweight/speedy xlsx reading and writing. Not everything is tested (in memory reading for instance). Basic reading should work.

NOTE: You should have xlsxio_write and xlsxio_read installed in your system in a way nim can infer their locations (either by path or cli switches). This wrapper won't compile without them.
